This project, "YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing," represents a comprehensive exploration of data extraction, processing, and storage from YouTube channels. The primary objective is to harvest valuable data,
store it efficiently in MongoDB as a NoSQL database, process it using SQL for relational database management and present insights through an interactive Streamlit web application.

The process begins with Python programming for data extraction, leveraging various YouTube channels as the source. MongoDB is then employed to facilitate flexible and scalable NoSQL storage. The project further incorporates SQL for structured data storage, providing a solid foundation for relational database management, accommodating the dynamic nature of YouTube data.

To enhance user interaction and visualization, the project utilizes Streamlit to create an engaging web application. This application allows users to dynamically explore and gain insights from the harvested YouTube data, making the information more accessible and actionable.
